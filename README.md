# Web_Scraping_Bitcoin.com
In this project I am trying to scrape the Bitcoin.com website and download various parameters belonging to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. I am using Selenium for this web scraping.

## Downloads 
- You need to install Selenium on your system. Command : pip install Selenium 
- You need to download the chromedriver that is compatible to your chrome version. (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
- Once the chromedriver is downloaded , place it in a location accesable by the code.
